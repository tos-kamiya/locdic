Locdic
========

Locdic is a dictionary tool, aims to make an off-line 
dictionary, in both forms of a command-line tool ( `ldfind` ) 
and a micro-web application ( `ldweb` ).

Locdic can use a utf-8 text data as dictionary data. So 
if you prepare such text files (e.g., ejdic-hand-utf8 for 
English-Japanese dictionary), you can make your own dictionary.
See `data/readme` for more information.
