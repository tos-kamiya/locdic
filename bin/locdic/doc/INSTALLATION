Installation
===============

To try Locdic without modifying system directories::

  $cd where/archive/is/expanded
  $bin/ldweb

or::
  
  $bin/ldfind someword
  
To install into system directories, run setup.py::

  $cd where/archive/is/expanded
  $sudo python setup.py

Then you'll find the above `ldweb` and `ldfind` are copied 
into directory `/usr/local/bin`.  Also the other files 
are copied to directories under `/usr/local/bin/locdic/` .
So you can run Locdic just as follows:: 

  $ldweb

or::
  
  $ldfind

Enjoy!
