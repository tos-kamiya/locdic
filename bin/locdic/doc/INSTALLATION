Installation
===============

To try without modifying system directories::

  $cd where/archive/is/expanded
  $bin/ldweb

or::
  
  $bin/ldfind
  
To install into system directories, run setup.py::

  $cd where/archive/is/expanded
  $sudo python setup.py

Then you'll find the above ldweb and ldfind are copied 
into directory `/usr/local/bin` and also the other files 
are copied to directories under `/usr/local/bin/locdic/` .
