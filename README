Locdic
========

Locdic is a dictionary tool, aims to make an off-line dictionary,
in both forms of a command-line tool (ldfind) and a micro-web application (ldweb).

Locdic uses utf-8 text data as dictionary data, however, locdic distribution 
does not contain such data, so you need to prepare such text files
(e.g., ejdic-hand-utf8 for English-Japanese dictionary).
