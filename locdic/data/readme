About data directory
========================

This directory includes a wordnet English dictionary,
as one of the most practical and famous dictionary,
which is suitable as a default dictionary and also
a good sample to explain what locdic dictionary is.

User dictionary 
==================

This `locdic/data` directory is a default data directory of
Locdic. However, this directory is a system directory if
you installed Locdic with setup.py.

In case you want to use your own dictionary data with Locdic,
make a directory under your home directory: `~/.locdic/data/`,
then put the data in the directory.

Such directory data file must satisfy the following:

- A utf-8 encoded text file.

- A word and its description are included in a line of the file.

Data importing scripts
==========================

Scripts import_XXXX.py is a special import (convert) tool 
for dictionary data XXXX. These scripts convert the dictionary 
data of its own format into a utf-8 text file, in order to 
make the data usable by Locdic.

To use the scripts, download the dictionary data archive 
and expand it in some directory, and type following command 
at terminal::

  $cd the/directory/where/the/archive/is/expanded
  $python import_XXXX.py
