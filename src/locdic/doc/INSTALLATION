Install
---------

To try Locdic without modifying system directories::

  $ cd where/archive/is/expanded
  $ python src/locdic/web.py

or::
  
  $ python src/locdic/find.py "key word"
  
To install to the system (Python's dist-package directory), 
run `setup.py install` as usual::

  $ cd where/archive/is/expanded
  $ sudo python setup.py install

Now Locdic can be used by all users of the system, 
like as follows:: 

  $ python -m locdic.web
  
or::
  
  $ python -m locdic.find "key word"

Enjoy!

Un-install
-------------

Remove locdic-related directories and files in Python's 
dist-package directory, like::

  $ sudo rm -rf /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/locdic*

In case of you are using Python 2.7.
